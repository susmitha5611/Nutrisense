## Important Notes

- **tavily-python removed**: The original requirements.txt included tavily-python, but it's not used in the codebase. It has been removed to prevent installation issues.
- **Web search functionality**: The project uses Mistral's built-in web search capabilities via the `{"type": "web_search"}` tool type, not external packages.
- **Private API access**: This project uses `mistralai-private` package which requires special access. Make sure you have the correct API key and access permissions.
